          <p>This idea was in the making for a long time. We Just never really thought of a way to promote how we would would tackle the problem. These days, there is sooooooo much information on the internet about soooooo many different things, it's really easy to get lost in the ocean of data and opinions. I used to get on the internet and ask people in forums and blogs how they liked this or that product. This was effective but sometimes took weeks to get an answer. Then I got my first job as a chat agent for a smaller company. </p>
          <p>When I started working for this company, it was just building on knowledge I already had about technology. This was really cool for me. I got to talk about speakers and computers all day. Two of my favorite things! I was making a decent chunk of change, but still didn't feel right because it felt like our informative service was all about sales. Every time you log in, it's somone barking "Sell Sell Sell! you need more sales! everyone has to sell!". It quit feeling like it was for the customer as soon as they logged into the chat.</p>
          <p>After I left this company I was a little upset because I really liked what I did. I liked helping people, but I needed it to feel like it was more about the customer and not sales. That way I know they are taken care of properly. After hours of countless research and questioning every little detail. It hit me like a brick to the face. "Start your own chat service that is actually informative idiot!" for a few bucks a month I can host a static site with basic features which we can gradually expand. Thus, Mithril Tech Advisors was born.</p>
          <p>I never even thought twice about offering the service for money. I instantly said, "This absolutely has to be free". With no traffic that can get expensive to pay for a site. So I came up with the tipping method. This would be the keystone for income on the website. </p>
